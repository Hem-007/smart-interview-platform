## Pre-Production Setup

### 1. OpenAI Account Setup
- [ ] Create OpenAI account at https://platform.openai.com
- [ ] Verify email address
- [ ] Add payment method
- [ ] Create API key
- [ ] Copy API key to secure location
- [ ] Set usage limits/alerts

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Verify environment variable is set:
  ```bash
  echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
  ```
- [ ] Configure `openai.model` (gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo)
- [ ] Set `openai.max-tokens` based on needs
- [ ] Adjust `openai.temperature` if needed

### 3. Database Preparation
- [ ] Backup existing database
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Verify `feedback` column added to `CodeSubmissions` table:
  ```sql
  DESCRIBE CodeSubmissions;
  ```
- [ ] Verify column properties:
  - Type: VARCHAR(2000)
  - Nullable: YES
  - Default: NULL

### 4. Application Configuration
- [ ] Update `application.properties` with OpenAI config
- [ ] Verify all required properties are set
- [ ] Test configuration loading:
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- [ ] Check logs for configuration messages

### 5. Build & Package
- [ ] Clean build:
  ```bash
  mvn clean package -DskipTests
  ```
- [ ] Verify build succeeds
- [ ] Check for any warnings
- [ ] Verify JAR file created
- [ ] Test JAR file:
  ```bash
  java -jar target/smart-interview-platform-*.jar
  ```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Check test coverage
- [ ] Review test logs

### 2. Start Application
- [ ] Start application in staging environment
- [ ] Monitor startup logs
- [ ] Verify no errors in logs
- [ ] Check application health endpoint
- [ ] Verify database connection

### 3. Manual Testing
- [ ] Submit test code via API:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8181/submission/submit \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "code": "public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }",
      "language": "Java",
      "status": "Accepted",
      "user": { "id": 1 },
      "question": { "id": 1 }
    }'
  ```
- [ ] Verify response includes feedback
- [ ] Check feedback quality
- [ ] Verify feedback stored in database
- [ ] Check logs for [FEEDBACK_SERVICE] entries

### 4. Error Scenario Testing
- [ ] Test with invalid API key
- [ ] Test with empty code
- [ ] Test with null language
- [ ] Test with very long code
- [ ] Test with special characters
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling

### 5. Performance Testing
- [ ] Submit multiple code samples
- [ ] Measure response times
- [ ] Monitor API usage
- [ ] Check for rate limiting
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage

### 6. Logging Verification
- [ ] Check application logs
- [ ] Verify [FEEDBACK_SERVICE] entries
- [ ] Verify [CODE_SUBMISSION] entries
- [ ] Check for any ERROR level logs
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs
